## Features

The Provider handles all non-blockchain related core functionality, including compute and storage interfaces, and connections to Ocean Keepers. Additionally, the Provider implements Ocean's Service Integrity and Orchestration capabilities, allowing for services to be requested, ordered, scheduled, verfied, and curated. 

## Prerequisites

You should have running a instance of BigchainDB and ganache-cli. 
You can start running the docker-compose in the docker directory:

```docker
docker-compose up
```

## Quick Start

The most simple way to start is:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:oceanprotocol/provider.git
cd provider/

export FLASK_APP=provider/run.py
export CONFIG_FILE=oceandb.ini 
flask run
```


## API documentation

Once you have your application running you can access to the documentation in:

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/docs
```

## Configuration


In the configuration there are now three sections:

- oceandb: Contains different values to connect with oceandb. You can find more information about how to use OceanDB [here](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandb-driver-interface).
- keeper-contracts: This section help you to connect with the network where you have deployed the contracts.
    ```yaml
    [keeper-contracts]
    keeper.host=0.0.0.0
    keeper.port=8545
    #contracts.folder=venv/contracts
    market.address=0xbc0be3598a31715bac5235718f96bb242804e61e
    auth.address=0x6ba5f72e5399aa67db5b22ee791851937d4910f5
    token.address=0xfd83b273b395b1029c41bb32071500bf662e6a8a
    provider.address=
    ```
- resources: This section have properties to connect with the different resourcer provideres. At the moment we are only using Azure but this is going to increase quickly.
    ```yaml
    [resources]
    azure.account.name=testocnfiles
    azure.account.key=k2Vk4yfb88WNlWW+W54a8ytJm8MYO1GW9IgiV7TNGKSdmKyVNXzyhiRZ3U1OHRotj/vTYdhJj+ho30HPyJpuYQ==
    azure.container=testfiles
    ```
    

## Code style

The information about code style in python is documented in this two links [python-developer-guide](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/dev-ocean/blob/master/doc/development/python-developer-guide.md)
and [python-style-guide](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/dev-ocean/blob/master/doc/development/python-style-guide.md).
